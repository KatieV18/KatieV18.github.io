                <h3>1. How to define the difference between leopards and jaguars </h3>
                <p>There is a difference between the two, Jaguars have a big head with powerful jaws for biting into the head of prey. They are the only big cat known to kill their prey like this. Leopards have a thinner face. This is an easy why to tell them apart.</p>

                <h3>2. Black panthers are actually black jaguars</h3>
                <p>Black panthers from south america are actually black jaguars. This is due to the genertic condition they have called melanism. About 10% of Jaguars in the wilf are black and provide them with camouflage when hunting at night.</p>
                <p>If you look closely you can see the markings faintly on their fur</p>

                <h3>4. They are near threatened!</h3>
                <p>Jaguars used to live in the Grand canyon. But due to government hunting they have now been completely elimated from the U.S. They are now endangered throughout their habitat of centeral and south america due to habitat destruction, trophy hunting and conflict with humans. </p>
